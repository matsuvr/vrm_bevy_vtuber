# ADR-013: Guarded NDI runtime distribution

Status: Accepted for Issue #49 implementation; legal and machine acceptance
gate remains pending
Date: 2026-08-18

## Context

Issue #47 intentionally keeps the NDI SDK out of the normal workspace build
and Git history. Issue #49 needs a reproducible Windows x64 release path
without silently downloading or redistributing a proprietary SDK component.
The exact SDK package and agreement, not a summary in an issue, determine
whether application-local runtime distribution is permitted.

## Decision

- Keep the default workspace and source package SDK-free.
- Enable the sender only with the explicit ndi-output feature.
- Stage only the exact Standard SDK x64 runtime filename
  Processing.NDI.Lib.x64.dll, supplied explicitly by the build operator.
- Require the exact SDK license agreement file, SDK version, and SDK package
  SHA-256 as package inputs.
- Place the runtime beside vtuber-desktop.exe; never install it into a
  system directory, edit PATH, or include NDI Tools.
- Generate NDI_RUNTIME_MANIFEST.txt with runtime/license hashes and explicit
  exclusions for Advanced/HX, audio, and system installation.
- Require THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md to contain the NDI attribution and official
  link. The Live UI also links to the official NDI site.
- Verify a flat, allow-listed package before it is treated as a staging
  result.
- Do not commit runtime DLLs, SDK headers, import libraries, or the exact
  agreement to the normal source tree.

cargo xtask ndi package performs staging and structural/hash checks. It is a
guardrail, not legal advice and not proof that a particular SDK agreement
permits distribution.

## Consequences

The release operator must obtain and review the exact SDK agreement and
record its package hash before a release. If application-local distribution is
not permitted, the release is blocked and Issue #45 must be updated; the
repository does not switch to an unlicensed workaround.

Numeric NDI receiver/alpha and clean-machine checks remain separate from
automated Rust tests. OBS and DistroAV are receiver-side dependencies and are
not redistributed here.
