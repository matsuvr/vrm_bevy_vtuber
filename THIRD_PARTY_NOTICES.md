## NDI® runtime

This application can optionally use the NDI Standard SDK runtime for
transparent avatar output. The runtime DLL is not included in the normal
source tree and must only be staged from the exact SDK package used for a
release, after its license agreement and SDK documentation have been checked.

NDI® is a registered trademark of Vizrt NDI AB. See the official
[NDI developer site](https://ndi.video/) and the
[NDI SDK documentation](https://docs.ndi.video/all/developing-with-ndi/sdk).

The NDI runtime is a separate proprietary component and is not covered by the
MIT OR Apache-2.0 terms of this application. A release that bundles it must
include the exact SDK license/notice material required by that SDK package.
The repository's cargo xtask ndi package command requires that material as
an explicit input and records its SHA-256 in the generated package manifest.

This project does not redistribute NDI Tools, NDI Advanced/HX components,
audio codecs, SDK headers, import libraries, or build artifacts. The runtime
is loaded application-locally; the package process does not install anything
into a system directory or edit PATH.

## grafton-ndi

The Rust sender boundary uses
[grafton-ndi v1.0.0](https://github.com/GrantSparks/grafton-ndi), licensed
under Apache-2.0. Its source and license are obtained through Cargo; the NDI
SDK runtime remains a separately governed distribution component.
