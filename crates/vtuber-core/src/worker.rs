//! Deterministic worker supervision helpers.
//!
//! This module provides a small, std-only wrapper around named threads,
//! cooperative stop tokens, and typed join results. It is intended for
//! camera and inference workers that must own their backend objects inside
//! a single thread and shut down cleanly.
